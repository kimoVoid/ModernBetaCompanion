> [!IMPORTANT]
> This mod requires the <b>[Beta QOL mod](https://github.com/kimoVoid/BetaQOL/releases/latest)</b> mod to work.

  - Also reads join/quit messages to update it
- Adjusted the breaking speed of some blocks:
  - Redstone ores
  - Stairs
  - Furnaces
  - Crafting tables

## Known limitations
Since the mod can only read player names, ping won't be correct. This also makes it impossible to show ranks in the player list.

## Credits
The block fixes were inspired by [AnnoyanceFix](https://modrinth.com/mod/annoyancefix-stationapi-edition) for Babric.
